    In (_, i) => ..., the underscore _ is just a placeholder for the first argument, which we are not using.
    We use `_` as a variable name when we want to ignore a function argument that we donâ€™t need.  
    JavaScript requires us to include all arguments in the function signature, even if we only use one of them.  
    By convention, `_` signals to other developers that this argument is intentionally unused.
    For example, in `(_, i) => ...`, we only care about `i` (the index), but the function still receives the first argument, so we use `_` as a placeholder.  
    It helps make the code more readable and shows that the first argument is not important in this context.

  The expression (Math.random() * 2 + 3).toFixed(1) is used to generate a random number between 3.0 (inclusive) and 5.0 (exclusive).

  The '2' sets the range width (max - min).
  
  Math.random() generates a value from 0.0 (inclusive) up to, but not including, 1.0 (exclusive).
  Math.random() * 2 generates a value from 0.0 (inclusive) up to, but not including, 2.0 (exclusive).
  So, min = 0.0, max = 2.0 (exclusive).
